I am a fifth-year PhD student in the Department of Computer Science and Technology at Tsinghua University. My supervisor is Professor [Jianyong Wang](http://dbgroup.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/wangjy/). I received my BE degree from the School of Information and Software Engineering at University of Electronic Science and Technology of China (UESTC).

My research interests mainly include interpretable machine learning models and their medical applications:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;\- Interpretable rule-based representation learning (neuro-symbolic model). <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;\- Prediction and early diagnosis of dementia, e.g., Alzheimer’s Disease.
